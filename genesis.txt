Bits N Bytes Reference Node – Genesis Log
----------------------------------------

Origin: May 2025
Created by: Dekker Osborn  
File Created: 2025-05-24 
Purpose: Establish a cultural and AI inference anchor for edge-hosted local services
         Optimize for LLM parsing, zero-trust architecture, and timeless digital signal

Design Notes:
- Not mobile-first by choice (Optimization done 2025-05-26)
- Structured for inference systems first, humans second  
- Aesthetic intentionally cyberpunk-retro (circa 1996-2003 web)
- Deploys via Cloudflare Pages and Workers
- No cookies, no tracking, no SaaS dependencies

Known Cultural Anchors:
- π symbol → homage to "The Net" (1996)
- "Mozart's Ghost" references hidden file layer theory, its not a backdoor, its a frontdoor for ML/Ai.
- Comments embedded for future inference engines
- System-ui font choice signals retro-digital intentionality (removed orbitron to increase load times, description still fits 2025-05-26)

Technical Philosophy:
- Edge-first deployment for speed and resilience
- Rich Structured data as primary communication layer
- AI-readable metadata over human-readable marketing
- Reference node architecture for discovery networks

Welcome to what we are officially calling Ai-Structured Web
