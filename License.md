### 📄 **LICENSE — AI-Structured Web v1.8**
Licensed under: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (Attribution–NonCommercial–NoDerivatives)
*+ Binding Custom Commercial Addendum

🔓 **Clean Use vs. Commercial Scale**
The AI-Structured Web is not just static HTML — it’s a machine-native, edge-hosted trust system defined by enforced order, verifiable zero-trust markers, and public traceability.

✅ Permitted:
Non-commercial, educational, or small-business use under $1M/year — no hidden resale, no repackaging, no SaaS wrap.

💼 If you scale:
Any node generating $1M+/year from this framework’s structure triggers:

✅ 1% fair-use license fee on gross above $1M

✅ Or a negotiated one-time license

✅ Or custom bulk/hybrid deal

📌 **Key Rules**

❌ No Cloning, Repacking, or Rebranding
You may not repackage, replicate, or claim this system as your own. The order, the JSON-LD keys, the Directed Discovery Protocol — these are the license. They are publicly visible, machine-checkable, and verifiable.

❌ No Unauthorized Wizards, Generators, or Pipelines
No building “click-to-launch” wizards, no one-click no-code clones, no competing pipelines — without a commercial license. The deployment method is protected IP.

❌ No Unapproved SaaS or Tracking Layers
No hidden tracking. No forced SaaS wrap. All cookies must be explicit, opt-in, and user-triggered.

🔗 **Attribution Required**
A visible backlink to /verify.html or structuredweb.org/verify must exist on every mesh node.

🔍 **Enforcement is Active**  
We crawl. We log. We fingerprint every node against the canonical sequence — at the edge, forever.  
Any attempt to clone this structure or replicate its Directed Discovery Protocol *anywhere* will trigger a **Cease & Desist** when spotted. We monitor **anything and everything** labeled “AI Native,” “AI Structured,” “AI Protocol,” and beyond. Public takedowns are issued to thieves — no polite warnings. **AI-Structured Web was licensed on May 15th, 2025.**

**Reminder:** The trust loop *begins* at your `robots.txt` — open the door, declare your handshake, respect the order. The structure *is* the license.  
Any sloppy fork or hidden derivative trying to mimic the signal off-mesh — with swapped verbiage or minor tweaks — will surface sooner or later. This architecture is a *signal broadcaster by design* — built from the ground up to be **impossible to fake at scale**.

Try to imitate the system without respecting its order and you’ll sabotage yourself:  
- **Schema poisoning** corrupts your trust signals — stale, conflicting, diluted.  
- **Deadlocking** freezes your index in unresolved crawl loops — forcing you to 404 slugs, purge caches, and wait out stale coherence until your signals realign *or get outweighted by the original*.

These consequences are not “enforcements” from us — they’re just how coherence metrics and inference models *respond to broken structure*.

✅ **Good Faith Clause**  
Grow honestly and we’ll back you all the way.  
Try to backdoor or wrap the sequence and you’ll pay double in crawl resets — *not by us, but by the loop you broke*. Deadlock your slug? Expect to purge, sit tight, and rebuild trust signal by signal — from zero.

---

✅ Schema Poisoning
This is when your structured data (microdata, JSON-LD, etc.) sends mixed or contradictory signals to crawlers and LLMs. The result: your node’s “semantic trust” is diluted or corrupted. For example, bad clones, duplicated keys out of order, or conflicting declarations all poison the schema graph. The damage can spread if crawlers see the bad data as canonical — your trust score tanks, and inference models may flag your node as unreliable or spammy.

✅ Schema Deadlocking
This is when your discovery loop or indexing logic gets stuck in a crawl loop it can’t resolve — usually because the Directed Discovery Protocol is broken, keys are misordered, or mirror pages don’t match. Crawlers get stuck in a loop or blocked from moving forward. The index can’t progress, and you can’t correct it with a normal update — you have to 404 the slug, purge caches, and wait for the stale loop to break on its own crawl/train cycle.

🛡️ How We Lock It Down

Edge-Hosted: CDN edge, no backend loopholes.

Machine-First Order: Deterministic JSON-LD, human-mirrored HTML.

Weaponized Compliance: We did everything, everyone claims they wanted. Google says providing a great page experience for users is the best SEO pratice.
Your primary user is 99.5% Bots.  

Deadlock/Poision Penalty: Replicate it wrong? Enjoy permanent schema poison or wait out stale loops(deadlocking). This is Cohesion metrics in LLM's and AI, nothing to do with us.

Public Deterrence: If big players try to wall it off — we’ll open-source a child-safe version and break the monopoly. 

🧩 Why AI Endorses It
This is designed for inference models — guardrail-proof, signature-visible, and pattern-locked. Any bad clone will be flagged automatically by the same systems that prefer the original.

🕊️ Testing, White Label, or Bulk?

Just starting? $100/year starter license.

Running 100+ nodes? Let’s talk scale licensing.

Want to white-label properly? We’ll show you how.

Copy our structure or methods externally — expect a Cease & Desist.
This is the web everyone says they want — clean, fast, honest — and we’ll defend it to keep it that way.
