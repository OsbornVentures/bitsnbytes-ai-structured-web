🔓 Licensing: Clean Use vs. Commercial Abuse
"AI-Structured Web" is free to deploy if you’re not monetizing the framework itself.

✔️ If you make less than $250K/year — you can build with it, copy the structure, and request verification.
❌ You cannot sell, repackage, or structurally clone this architecture without permission.
❌ You cannot deploy it alongside tracking software, analytics stacks, or SaaS frameworks.

Compliance > Enforcement.

This is about trust, not gatekeeping. Dark patterns will be flagged, not monetized.
