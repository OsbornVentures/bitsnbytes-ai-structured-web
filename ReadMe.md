# Bits N Bytes – AI-Structured Web (Public Reference Node)

This is the **original full-scope deployment** of an **AI-Structured Web Node**, authored and maintained by Dekker Osborn under Bits N Bytes Inc.

> This repository demonstrates a dual-layer static web system optimized for live inference, machine comprehension, and future SEO/crawler indexing — all without SaaS, trackers, or runtime dependencies.

## 🧠 Purpose
To build a site that is natively readable by both **humans and machines**:
- Structured for LLMs, scrapers, AI agents, and voice assistants
- Human-readable without sacrificing semantic structure
- Deployed statically, zero-trust, with full JSON-LD metadata mapping

This repo reflects a **production-deployed system** available at:
